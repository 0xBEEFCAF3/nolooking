# Lightning Optimizing Opening Server

(lopto≈° ~ naughty boy/brat/hooligan/..., not to be confused with lopta == ball)

## WARNING: ULTRA-EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE!!!

**This project is very early and lacks basic checks (that means it's NOT fully BIP78-compliant)!
For the love of god, do NOT use it on mainnet just yet!
If you don't want to wait long, help with reviews and PRs.**

This server optimizes your channel opening from a remote wallet which supports PayJoin.
It enables you to open a channel on remote LND with empty wallet using sats in PayJoin-compliant wallet.
This way you save one chain transaction when opening from Wasabi, BTCPayServer, Blue Wallet or other PayJoin-supporting wallet.
It's basically a user-friendly way to do PSBT funding flow.

And yes, int he future you could give the URI/QR code to someone else, so you receive PayJoin transaction and simultaneously open Lightning channel with received money.

## Limitations and future plans

* **MOST LIKELY UNSAFE** does not implement required BIP78 checks
* **Only works with a [forked LND](https://github.com/guggero/lnd/tree/psbt-no-final-tx)** - there's a PR against LND, should land in 0.14.
* Funds in LND or other wallet are not used, so it's not true PayJoin, just abuses the protocol to coordinate PSBT.
* CLI-only
* No way to inteligently manipulate the amount
* No discount possible
* Invalid request can kill whole server
* `.unwraps()`s EVERYWHERE!
* I swear I knew about a few more but can't remember right now :D

## Usage

0. You need a [recent version of Rust](https://rustup.rs) to compile this.
1. You need to clone the **forked** LND: `git clone -b psbt-no-final-tx https://github.com/guggero/lnd/`
2. `LND_REPO_DIR=path/to/forked/lnd/ cargo build`
3. Build forked LND
4. Deploy forked LND (replacing binary in deployment followed by restart works)
5. Setup reverse HTTP proxy with HTTPS forwarding to some port - e.g. 3000.
   You can do this in a few lines using [selfhost in Cryptoanarchy Debian Repository](https://github.com/debian-cryptoanarchy/cryptoanarchy-deb-repo-builder/blob/master/docs/user-level.md#selfhost).
6. Connect to the peer using `lncli connect ...`
7. `./target/debug/loptos HTTP_BIND_PORT https://LND_GRPC_ADDRESS /path/to/cert/file /path/to/admin.macaroon DEST_NODE_ID AMOUN_IN_SATS`
8. Copy BIP21 from command line output and paste it into one of the supported wallets
9. Confirm the transaction and pray it works
